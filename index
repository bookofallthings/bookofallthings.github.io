* Metaphyscis

* Epistemology

. Study of the nature of human knowledge

** Correspondence theory of truth

. Single most fundamental idea from Epistemology

. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correspondence_theory_of_truth

** what do you get if you don't use the correspondance theory of truth

** The arbitrary

** Context

. Everything that affects the truth of idea

. All knowledge is contextual

** Reality is like a chicken

. Correspondence theory of truth extends to concepts

** Dictionaries are descriptive and not prescriptive

** Hierarchy

. You can't use something at the end to deny something at the
beginning

** Logic

. There are four kinds

** Deduction only in agreed context

** A "logical" proof doesn't create truth

** Validity of the senses

** Frozen abstraction

** Words hold more than single concepts

. This causes a lot of confusion

** Implicit versus explicit knowledge/ideas

. You use implicit ideas without even knowing it

. Implicit ideas are ideas that are logically required and used but
their use is unstated, unrecognized

** Truth/knowledge isn't a static thing that exists independency of
   everything else

** arguing from fundamentals is the best

** Deduction ruins people

** The power of fundamentals

** Grouping unlike things under a concept hurts truth - makes less
   that you can say is true about a concept

* Morality

** Is-ought problem

** Emergency situations are outside of morality

* Politics

** Rights

. The bridge from morality to politics

** List of real rights

** Free markets are free people doing free things

** Health care

*** Why is health care so expensive?

. You are paying for the health care of other people

. Health insurance is expensive because it's not insurance

*** Health insurance tied to your job because of the government

*** Why is emergency room health care so expensive?

*** Rise of the admins in health care - huge increase over the years

** We live in a simulation

** Socrates is bad because

** Socialism is bad

** Communism is bad

** How to get politics from morality

** What is wrong with NDT?

** Proof and truth is more than deduction and logical arguments - the
   words need to be right - the world view needs to be right

** You can't complain about how things are when they aren't man-made

** You have to accept the metaphysically given but not the man-made

** The natural state of man is having nothing - we built all this

** Reason is man's tool of survival

** The unit of morality is the individual

** Gun stuff - What is the plan?

** Without ought from is you tend to slip into duty ethics

** deduction and proofs are more like a prompt to look at the truth of
   something than actually creating truth

** what's wrong with pragmatism

** When you scramble up concepts you get a new that often results in
   compromises, half measures, and no real truth

** There is no being right for the wrong reasons - you can't defend
   what you know properly - you can't validate it

** Government is not just people getting together and deciding how to
   do things

** A proper government becomes less important than the government we
   have now

** conclusions replace actual evidence when you are seeing something
   new/reasoning about a new thing

** other types of arguments besides by fundamental can help too, but
   they aren't the best

** arguing via metaphors sucks

** we don't have capitalism in the USA

** left (and to a lesser extent the right) shutting down speach

** very little difference betweeen Republicans and Democrats

** tap me on the shoulder when Democrats or Republicans do something
   about the unsustainable, combined problems of national debt and
   national entitlement programs - the combination of which the CBO
   calls unsustatinable as the years roll by
